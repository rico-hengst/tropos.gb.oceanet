# oceanet_development

The repo contains scripts to convert measurements (oceanet) to the [pangaea data format](https://wiki.pangaea.de/wiki/Data_submission).
**This repo is in development.**

The current predecessor repo contains scripts based on idl. This repo will substitute idl by python.
Furthermore the scripts are adapted to process oceanet data which are organized by instruments, not organized by Polarstern cruises.
