The radiation data are acquired with a temporal resolution 1 second at the bow crane boom of the ship from 06 October 2019 – 02 October 2020, Arctic Ocean. The measurement had been done for the short-wave downward (GLOBAL) radiation by a pyranometer, Kipp & Zonen, CM21 and for the long-wave downward radiation by a pyrgeometer, Kipp & Zonen, CGR4. The long-wave downward radiation is the same as the downward thermal-infrared radiation (DTIR).",
